## 4. Key Findings and Recommendations

Based on the initial test execution of the Foody application, a pass rate of 77% was achieved, and a large number of critical and systemic issues were identified.

### Key Findings

- **Critical Functionality Is Broken**: Three critical bugs were discovered, which indicates major defects in the core functionality of the application that require immediate attention.

- **High-Impact Issues**: There are a total of 6 high-severity bugs and 8 high-priority bugs, suggesting significant issues with core features and user workflows.

- **Systemic UI Problems**: Systemic issues were identified, such as missing visual indicators for required fields, which should be addressed with a single, global solution.

- **Missing Requirements**: A total of 7 queries were logged for missing or unclear requirements. This prevents the creation of a complete test plan and the full execution of testing.

### Recommendations
- **Prioritize Critical and High-Priority Bugs**: We recommend that the development team immediately address the 3 critical bugs and the 8 high-priority bugs.

- **Meet with the Product Owner**: It is recommended that we schedule a meeting with the Product Owner to review the 7 open queries. Without clarification on constraints and other requirements, further comprehensive testing cannot be performed.

- **Perform Regression Testing**: Once the identified bugs have been fixed, a full regression test should be performed to ensure that the fixes did not introduce any new issues.
